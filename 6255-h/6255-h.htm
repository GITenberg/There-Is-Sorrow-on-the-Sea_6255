               &ldquo;YORK FACTORY, HUDSON&rsquo;S BAY,
                  &ldquo;23rd September, 1747.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR COUSIN FANNY,&mdash;It was a year last April Fool&rsquo;s Day, I left
      you on the sands there at Mablethorpe, no more than a stone&rsquo;s throw from
      the Book-in-Hand Inn, swearing that you should never see me or hear from
      me again. You remember how we saw the coast-guards flash their lights here
      and there, as they searched the sands for me? how one came bundling down
      the bank, calling, &lsquo;Who goes there?&rsquo; You remember that when I said, &lsquo;A
      friend,&rsquo; he stumbled, and his light fell to the sands and went out, and in
      the darkness you and I stole away: you to your home, with a whispering,
      &lsquo;God-bless-you, Cousin Dick,&rsquo; over your shoulder, and I with a bit of a
      laugh that, maybe, cut to the heart, and that split in a sob in my own
      throat&mdash;though you didn&rsquo;t hear that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas a bad night&rsquo;s work that, Cousin Fanny, and maybe I wish it undone,
      and maybe I don&rsquo;t; but a devil gets into the heart of a man when he has to
      fly from the lass he loves, while the friends of his youth go hunting him
      with muskets, and he has to steal out of the backdoor of his own country
      and shelter himself, like a cold sparrow, up in the eaves of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, lass, that&rsquo;s how I left the fens of Lincolnshire a year last April
      Fool&rsquo;s Day. There wasn&rsquo;t a dyke from, Lincoln town to Mablethorpe that I
      hadn&rsquo;t crossed with a running jump; and there wasn&rsquo;t a break in the shore,
      or a sink-hole in the sand, or a clump of rushes, or a samphire bed, from
      Skegness to Theddlethorpe, that I didn&rsquo;t know like every line of your
      face. And when I was a slip of a lad-ay, and later too&mdash;how you and I
      used to snuggle into little nooks of the sand-hills, maybe just beneath
      the coast-guard&rsquo;s hut, and watch the tide come swilling in-water-daisies
      you used to call the breaking surf, Cousin Fanny. And that was like you,
      always with a fancy about everything you saw. And when the ships, the
      fishing-smacks with their red sails, and the tall-masted brigs went by,
      taking the white foam on their canvas, you used to wish that you might
      sail away to the lands you&rsquo;d heard tell of from old skippers that gathered
      round my uncle&rsquo;s fire in the Book-in-Hand. Ay, a grand thing I thought it
      would be, too, to go riding round the world on a well-washed deck, with
      plenty of food and grog, and maybe, by-and-by, to be first mate, and lord
      it from fo&rsquo;castle bunk to stern-rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not know, did you, who was the coast-guardsman that stumbled as
      he came on us that night? It looked a stupid thing to do that, and let the
      lantern fall. But, lass, &lsquo;twas done o&rsquo; purpose. That was the one man in
      all the parish that would ha&rsquo; risked his neck to let me free. &lsquo;Twas Lancy
      Doane, who&rsquo;s give me as many beatings in his time as I him. We were always
      getting foul one o&rsquo; t&rsquo;other since I was big enough to shy a bit of turf at
      him across a dyke, and there isn&rsquo;t a spot on&rsquo;s body that I haven&rsquo;t hit,
      nor one on mine that he hasn&rsquo;t mauled. I&rsquo;ve sat on his head, and he&rsquo;s had
      his knee in my stomach till I squealed, and we never could meet without
      back-talking and rasping &lsquo;gainst the grain. The night before he joined the
      coast-guardsmen, he was down at the Book-in-Hand, and &lsquo;twas little like
      that I&rsquo;d let the good chance pass&mdash;I might never have another; for
      Gover&rsquo;ment folk will not easy work a quarrel on their own account. I mind
      him sittin&rsquo; there on the settle, his shins against the fire, a long pipe
      going, and Casey of the Lazy Beetle, and Jobbin the mate of the Dodger,
      and Little Faddo, who had the fat Dutch wife down by the Ship Inn, and
      Whiggle the preaching blacksmith. And you were standin&rsquo; with your back to
      the shinin&rsquo; pewters, and the great jug of ale with the white napkin behind
      you; the light o&rsquo; the fire wavin&rsquo; on your face, and your look lost in the
      deep hollow o&rsquo; the chimney. I think of you most as you were that minute,
      Cousin Fanny, when I come in. I tell you straight and fair, that was the
      prettiest picture I ever saw; and I&rsquo;ve seen some rare fine things in my
      travels. &lsquo;Twas as if the thing had been set by some one, just to show you
      off to your best. Here you were, a slip of a lass, straight as a bulrush,
      and your head hangin&rsquo; proud on your shoulders; yet modest too, as you can
      see off here in the North the top of the golden-rod flower swing on its
      stem. You were slim as slim, and yet there wasn&rsquo;t a corner on you; so soft
      and full and firm you were, like the breast of a quail; and I mind me how
      the shine of your cheeks was like the glimmer of an apple after you&rsquo;ve
      rubbed it with a bit of cloth. Well, there you stood in some sort of
      smooth, plain, clingin&rsquo; gown, a little bit loose and tumblin&rsquo; at the
      throat, and your pretty foot with a brown slipper pushed out, just savin&rsquo; 
      you from bein&rsquo; prim. That&rsquo;s why the men liked you&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t carry a
      sermon in your waist-ribbon, and the Lord&rsquo;s Day in the lift o&rsquo; your chin;
      but you had a smile to give when &lsquo;twas the right time for it, and men
      never said things with you there that they&rsquo;d have said before many another
      maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas a thing I&rsquo;ve thought on off here, where I&rsquo;ve little to do but
      think, how a lass like you could put a finger on the lip of such rough
      tykes as Faddo, Jobbin, and the rest, keepin&rsquo; their rude words under flap
      and button. Do you mind how, when I passed you comin&rsquo; in, I laid my hand
      on yours as it rested on the dresser? That hand of yours wasn&rsquo;t a tiny bit
      of a thing, and the fingers weren&rsquo;t all taperin&rsquo; like a simperin&rsquo; miss
      from town, worked down in the mill of quality and got from graftin&rsquo; and
      graftin&rsquo;, like one of them roses from the flower-house at Mablethorpe Hall&mdash;not
      fit to stand by one o&rsquo; them that grew strong and sweet with no fancy
      colour, in the garden o&rsquo; the Book-in-Hand. Yours was a hand that talked as
      much as your lips or face, as honest and white; and the palm all pink, and
      strong as strong could be, and warmin&rsquo; every thread in a man&rsquo;s body when
      he touched it. Well, I touched your hand then, and you looked at me and
      nodded, and went musin&rsquo; into the fire again, not seemin&rsquo; to hear our
      gabble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, you remember&mdash;don&rsquo;t you?&mdash;how Jobbin took to chaffin&rsquo; of
      Lancy Doane, and how Faddo&rsquo;s tongue got sharper as the time got on, and
      many a nasty word was said of coast-guards and excisemen, and all that had
      to do with law and gover&rsquo;ment. Cuts there were at some of Lancy&rsquo;s wild
      doings in the past, and now and then they&rsquo;d turn to me, saying what they
      thought would set me girdin&rsquo; Lancy too. But I had my own quarrel, and I
      wasn&rsquo;t to be baited by such numskulls. And Lancy&mdash;that was a thing I
      couldn&rsquo;t understand&mdash;he did no more than shrug his shoulder and call
      for more ale, and wish them all good health and a hundred a year. I never
      thought he could ha&rsquo; been so patient-like. But there was a kind of little
      smile, too, on his face, showin&rsquo; he did some thinkin&rsquo;; and I guessed he
      was bidin&rsquo; his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t as sharp as I might ha&rsquo; been, or I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; seen what he was
      waitin&rsquo; for, with that quiet provokin&rsquo; smile on his face, and his eyes
      smoulderin&rsquo; like. I don&rsquo;t know to this day whether you wanted to leave the
      room when you did, though &lsquo;twas about half after ten o&rsquo;clock, later than I
      ever saw you there before. But when my uncle come in from Louth, and give
      you a touch on the shoulder, and said: &lsquo;To bed wi&rsquo; you, my lass,&rsquo; you
      waited for a minute longer, glancin&rsquo; round on all of us, at last lookin&rsquo; 
      steady at Lancy; and he got up from his chair, and took off his hat to you
      with a way he had. You didn&rsquo;t stay a second after that, but went away
      straight, sayin&rsquo; good-night to all of us, but Lancy was the only one on
      his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as soon as the door was shut behind you, Lancy turned round to the
      fire, and pushed the log with his feet in a way a man does when he&rsquo;s
      think-in&rsquo; a bit. And Faddo give a nasty laugh, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo; Theer&rsquo;s a dainty sitovation. Theer&rsquo;s Mr. Thomas Doane, outlaw and
      smuggler, and theer&rsquo;s Mr. Lancy Doane his brother, coast-guardsman. Now,
      if them two should &lsquo;appen to meet on Lincolnshire coast, Lord, theer&rsquo;s a
      sitovation for ye&mdash;Lord, theer&rsquo;s a cud to chew! &lsquo;Ere&rsquo;s one gentleman
      wants to try &lsquo;is &lsquo;and at &lsquo;elpin&rsquo; Prince Charlie, and when &lsquo;is Up doesn&rsquo;t
      amount to anythink, what does the King on &lsquo;is throne say? He says, &ldquo;As for
      Thomas Doane, Esquire, aw&rsquo;ve doone wi&rsquo; &lsquo;im.&rdquo; And theer&rsquo;s another
      gentleman, Mr. Lancy Doane, Esquire. He turns pious, and says, &ldquo;Aw&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; 
      for a coast-guardsman.&rdquo; What does the King on his throne say? &lsquo;E says,
      &ldquo;Theer&rsquo;s the man for me.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But aw says, &ldquo;Aw&rsquo;ve doone, aw&rsquo;ve doone wi&rsquo; Mr. Lancy Doane, Esquire, and
      be damned to &lsquo;im!&rdquo; He! he! Theer&rsquo;s a fancy sitovation for ye. Mr. Thomas
      Doane, Esquire, smuggler and outlaw, an&rsquo; Mr. Lancy Doane, Esquire,
      coast-guardsman. Aw&rsquo;ve doone. Ho! ho! That gits into my crop.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you these things, Cousin Fanny, because I&rsquo;m doubtin&rsquo; if you ever
      heard them, or knew exactly how things stood that night. I never was a
      friend of Lancy Doane, you understand, but it&rsquo;s only fair that the truth
      be told about that quarrel, for like as not he wouldn&rsquo;t speak himself, and
      your father was moving in and out; and, I take my oath, I wouldn&rsquo;t believe
      Faddo and the others if they was to swear on the Bible. Not that they
      didn&rsquo;t know the truth when they saw it, but they did love just to let
      their fancy run. I&rsquo;m livin&rsquo; over all the things that happened that night&mdash;livin&rsquo; 
      them over to-day, when everything&rsquo;s so quiet about me here, so lonesome. I
      wanted to go over it all, bit by bit, and work it out in my head, just as
      you and I used to do the puzzle games we played in the sands. And maybe,
      when you&rsquo;re a long way off from things you once lived, you can see them
      and understand them better. Out here, where it&rsquo;s so lonely, and yet so
      good a place to live in, I seem to get the hang o&rsquo; the world better, and
      why some things are, and other things aren&rsquo;t; and I thought it would pull
      at my heart to sit down and write you a long letter, goin&rsquo; over the whole
      business again; but it doesn&rsquo;t. I suppose I feel as a judge does when he
      goes over a lot of evidence, and sums it all up for the jury. I don&rsquo;t seem
      prejudiced one way or another. But I&rsquo;m not sure that I&rsquo;ve got all the
      evidence to make me ken everything; and that&rsquo;s what made me bitter wild
      the last time that I saw you. Maybe you hadn&rsquo;t anything to tell me, and
      maybe you had, and maybe, if you ever write to me out here, you&rsquo;ll tell me
      if there&rsquo;s anything I don&rsquo;t know about them days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go back now to what happened when Faddo was speakin&rsquo; at my
      uncle&rsquo;s bar. Lancy Doane was standin&rsquo; behind the settle, leanin&rsquo; his arms
      on it, and smokin&rsquo; his pipe quiet. He waited patient till Faddo had done,
      then he comes round the settle, puts his pipe up in the rack between the
      rafters, and steps in front of Faddo. If ever the devil was in a man&rsquo;s
      face, it looked out of Lancy Doane&rsquo;s that minute. Faddo had touched him on
      the raw when he fetched out that about Tom Doane. All of a sudden Lancy
      swings, and looks at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s half-past ten, Jim Faddo,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and aw&rsquo;ve got an hour an&rsquo; a
      half to deal wi&rsquo; you as a Lincolnshire lad. At twelve o&rsquo;clock aw&rsquo;m the
      Gover&rsquo;ment&rsquo;s, but till then aw&rsquo;m Lancy Doane, free to strike or free to
      let alone; to swallow dirt or throw it; to take a lie or give it. And now
      list to me; aw&rsquo;m not goin&rsquo; to eat dirt, and aw&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to give you the
      lie, and aw&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to break your neck, if I swing for it to-morrow, Jim
      Faddo. And here&rsquo;s another thing aw&rsquo;ll tell you. When the clock strikes
      twelve, on the best horse in the country aw&rsquo;ll ride to Theddlethorpe,
      straight for the well that&rsquo;s dug you know where, to find your smuggled
      stuff, and to run the irons round your wrists. Aw&rsquo;m dealin&rsquo; fair wi&rsquo; you
      that never dealt fair by no man. You never had an open hand nor soft
      heart; and because you&rsquo;ve made money, not out o&rsquo; smugglin&rsquo; alone, but out
      o&rsquo; poor devils of smugglers that didn&rsquo;t know rightly to be rogues, you
      think to fling your dirt where you choose. But aw&rsquo;ll have ye to-night as a
      man, and aw&rsquo;ll have ye to-night as a King&rsquo;s officer, or aw&rsquo;ll go damned to
      hell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he steps back a bit very shiny in the face, and his eyes like
      torchlights, but cool and steady. &lsquo;Come on now,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;Jim Faddo, away
      from the Book-in-Hand, and down to the beach under the sand-hills, and
      we&rsquo;ll see man for man&mdash;though, come to think of it, y &lsquo;are no man,&rsquo; 
      he said&mdash;&lsquo;if ye&rsquo;ll have the right to say when aw&rsquo;m a King&rsquo;s officer
      that you could fling foul words in the face of Lancy Doane. And a word
      more,&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;aw wouldn&rsquo;t trust ye if an Angel o&rsquo; Heaven swore for ye.
      Take the knife from the belt behind your back there, and throw it on the
      table, for you wouldn&rsquo;t bide by no fair rules o&rsquo; fightin&rsquo;. Throw the knife
      on the table,&rsquo; he says, comin&rsquo; a step forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faddo got on to his feet. He was bigger built than Lancy, and a bit
      taller, and we all knew he was devilish strong in his arms. There was a
      look in his face I couldn&rsquo;t understand. One minute I thought it was fear,
      and another I thought it was daze; and maybe it was both. But all on a
      sudden something horrible cunnin&rsquo; come into it, and ugly too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Go to the well, then, since ye&rsquo;ve found out all about it,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;but
      aw&rsquo;ve an hour and a half start o&rsquo; ye, Lancy Doane.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ye&rsquo;ve less than that,&rsquo; says Lancy back to him, &lsquo;if ye go with me to the
      sands first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that my uncle stepped in to say a word for peacemakin&rsquo;, but Lancy
      would have none of it. &lsquo;Take the knife and throw it on the table,&rsquo; he said
      to Faddo once more, and Faddo took it out and threw it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come on, then,&rsquo; Faddo says, with a sneerin&rsquo; laugh; &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll see by
      daybreak who has the best o&rsquo; this night&rsquo;s work,&rsquo; and he steps towards the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wait a minute,&rsquo; says Lancy, gettin&rsquo; in front of him. &lsquo;Now take the knife
      from your boot. Take it,&rsquo; he says again, &lsquo;or aw will. That&rsquo;s like a man,
      to go to a fist fight wi&rsquo; knives. Take it,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Aw&rsquo;ll gi&rsquo; ye till aw
      count four, and if ye doan&rsquo;t take it, aw&rsquo;ll take it meself. One!&rsquo; he says
      steady and soft. &lsquo;Two!&rsquo; Faddo never moved. &lsquo;Three!&rsquo; The silence made me
      sick, and the clock ticked like hammers. &lsquo;Four!&rsquo; he said, and then he
      sprang for the boot, but Faddo&rsquo;s hand went down like lightnin&rsquo; too. I
      couldn&rsquo;t tell exactly how they clinched but once or twice I saw the light
      flash on the steel. Then they came down together, Faddo under, and when I
      looked again Faddo was lying eyes starin&rsquo; wide, and mouth all white with
      fear, for Lancy was holding the knife-point at his throat. &lsquo;Stir an inch,&rsquo; 
      says Lancy, &lsquo;and aw&rsquo;ll pin ye to the lid o&rsquo; hell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three minutes by the clock he knelt there on Faddo&rsquo;s chest, the
      knife-point touching the bone in&rsquo;s throat. Not one of us stirred, but just
      stood lookin&rsquo;, and my own heart beat so hard it hurt me, and my uncle
      steadyin&rsquo; himself against the dresser. At last Lancy threw the knife away
      into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Coward!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;A man would ha&rsquo; taken the knife. Did you think aw was
      goin&rsquo; to gie my neck to the noose just to put your knife to proper use?
      But don&rsquo;t stir till aw gie you the word, or aw&rsquo;ll choke the breath o&rsquo; life
      out o&rsquo; ye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that Faddo sprung to clinch Lancy&rsquo;s arms, but Lancy&rsquo;s fingers caught
      him in the throat, and I thought surely Faddo was gone, for his tongue
      stood out a finger-length, and he was black in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Lancy,&rsquo; said my uncle, steppin&rsquo; forward, &lsquo;let him go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that Lancy said: &lsquo;He&rsquo;s right enough. It&rsquo;s not the first time aw&rsquo;ve
      choked a coward. Throw cold water on him and gi&rsquo; &lsquo;im brandy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure enough, he wasn&rsquo;t dead. Lancy stood there watchin&rsquo; us while we
      fetched Faddo back, and I tell you, that was a narrow squeak for him. When
      he got his senses again, and was sittin&rsquo; there lookin&rsquo; as if he&rsquo;d been
      hung and brought back to life, Lancy says to him: &lsquo;There, Jim Faddo, aw&rsquo;ve
      done wi&rsquo; you as a man, and at twelve o&rsquo;clock aw&rsquo;ll begin wi&rsquo; you as King&rsquo;s
      officer.&rsquo; And at that, with a good-night to my uncle and all of us, he
      turns on his heels and leaves the Book-in-Hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, Cousin Fanny, though I&rsquo;d been ripe for quarrel wi&rsquo; Lancy
      Doane myself that night, I could ha&rsquo; took his hand like a brother, for I
      never saw a man deal fairer wi&rsquo; a scoundrel than he did wi&rsquo; Jim Faddo. You
      see, it wasn&rsquo;t what Faddo said about himself that made Lancy wild, but
      that about his brother Tom; and a man doesn&rsquo;t like his brother spoken ill
      of by dirt like Faddo, be it true or false. And of Lancy&rsquo;s brother I&rsquo;m
      goin&rsquo; to write further on in this letter, for I doubt that you know all I
      know about him, and the rest of what happened that night and afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR COUSIN FANNY, I canna write all I set out to, for word come to me,
      just as I wrote the last sentence above, that the ship was to leave port
      three days sooner than was fixed for when I began. I have been rare and
      busy since then, and I have no time to write more. And so &lsquo;twill be
      another year before you get a word from me; but I hope that when this
      letter comes you&rsquo;ll write one back to me by the ship that sails next
      summer from London. The summer&rsquo;s short and the winter&rsquo;s long here, Cousin
      Fanny, and there&rsquo;s more snow than grass; and there&rsquo;s more flowers in a
      week in Mablethorpe than in a whole year here. But, lass, the sun shines
      always, and my heart keeps warm in thinkin&rsquo; of you, and I ask you to
      forgive me for any harsh word I ever spoke, not forgettin&rsquo; that last night
      when I left you on the sands, and stole away like a thief across the sea.
      I&rsquo;m going to tell you the whole truth in my next letter, but I&rsquo;d like you
      to forgive me before you know it all, for &lsquo;tis a right lonely and distant
      land, this, and who can tell what may come to pass in twice a twelve
      month! Maybe a prayer on lips like mine doesn&rsquo;t seem in place, for I&rsquo;ve
      not lived as parson says man ought to live, but I think the Lord will have
      no worse thought o&rsquo; me when I say, God bless thee, lass, and keep thee
      safe as any flower in His garden that He watereth with His own hand. Write
      to me, lass: I love thee still, I do love thee.

                    THE BOOK-IN-HAND INN,
                   MABLETHORPE, LINCOLNSHIRE.
                      May-Day, 1749.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR COUSIN DICK,&mdash;I think I have not been so glad in many years as
      when I got your letter last Guy Fawkes Day. I was coming from the church
      where the parson preached on plots and treasons, and obedience to the
      King, when I saw the old postman coming down the road. I made quickly to
      him, I know not why, for I had not thought to hear from you, and before I
      reached him he held up his hand, showing me the stout packet which brought
      me news of you. I hurried with it to the inn, and went straight to my room
      and sat down by the window, where I used to watch for your coming with the
      fishing fleet, down the sea from the Dogger Bank. I was only a girl, a
      young girl, then, and the Dogger Bank was, to my mind, as far off as that
      place you call York Factory, in Hudson&rsquo;s Bay, is to me now. And yet I did
      not know how very far it was until our schoolmaster showed me on a globe
      how few days&rsquo; sail it is to the Dogger Bank, and how many to York Factory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will tell you of my reading of your letter, and of what I thought.
      But first I must go back a little. When you went away that wild, dark
      night, with bitter words on your lips to me, Cousin Dick, I thought I
      should never feel the same again. You did not know it, but I was bearing
      the misery of your trouble and of another&rsquo;s also, and of my own as well;
      and so I said over and over again, Oh, why will men be hard on women? Why
      do they look for them to be iron like themselves, bearing double burdens
      as most women do? But afterwards I settled to a quietness which I would
      not have you think was happiness, for I have given up thought of that. Nor
      would I have you think me bearing trouble sweetly, for sometimes I was
      most hard and stubborn. But I lived on in a sort of stillness till that
      morning when, sitting by my window, I read all you had written to me. And
      first of all I must tell you how my heart was touched at your words about
      our childhood together. I had not thought it lay so deep in your mind,
      Cousin Dick. It always stays in mine; but then, women have more memories
      than men. The story of that night I knew; but never fully as you have told
      it to me in your letter. Of what happened after Lancy Doane left the inn,
      of which you have not written, but promised the writing in your next
      letter, I think I know as well as yourself. Nay, more, Cousin Dick. There
      are some matters concerning what followed that night and after, which I
      know, and you do not know. But you have guessed there was something which
      I did not tell you, and so there was. And I will tell you of them now. But
      I will take up the thread of the story where you dropped it, and reel it
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You left the inn soon after Lancy Doane, and James Faddo went then too,
      riding hard for Theddlethorpe, for he knew that in less than an hour the
      coast-guards would be rifling the hiding places of his smuggled stuff. You
      did not take a horse, but, getting a musket, you walked the sands hard to
      Theddlethorpe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it all, though you did not tell me, Cousin Dick. You had no
      purpose in going, save to see the end of a wretched quarrel and a
      smuggler&rsquo;s ill scheme. You carried a musket for your own safety, not with
      any purpose. It was a day of weight in your own life, for on one side you
      had an offer from the Earl Fitzwilliam to serve on his estate; and on the
      other to take a share in a little fleet of fishing smacks, of which my
      father was part owner. I think you know to which side I inclined, but that
      now is neither here nor there; and, though you did not tell me, as you
      went along the shore you were more intent on handing backwards and
      forwards in your mind your own affairs, than of what should happen at
      Theddlethorpe. And so you did not hurry as you went, and, as things
      happened, you came to Faddo&rsquo;s house almost at the same moment with Lancy
      Doane and two other mounted coast-guards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stood in the shadow while they knocked at Faddo&rsquo;s door. You were so
      near, you could see the hateful look in his face. You were surprised he
      did not try to stand the coast-guards off. You saw him, at their bidding,
      take a lantern, and march with them to a shed standing off a little from
      the house, nearer to the shore. Going a roundabout swiftly, you came to
      the shed first, and posted yourself at the little window on the sea-side.
      You saw them enter with the lantern, saw them shift a cider press, uncover
      the floor, and there beneath, in a dry well, were barrels upon barrels of
      spirits, and crouched among them was a man whom you all knew at once&mdash;Lancy&rsquo;s
      brother, Tom. That, Cousin Dick, was Jim Faddo&rsquo;s revenge. Tom Doane had
      got refuge with him till he should reach his brother, not knowing Lancy
      was to be coast-guard. Faddo, coming back from Mablethorpe, told Tom the
      coast-guards were to raid him that night; and he made him hide in this
      safe place, as he called it, knowing that Lancy would make for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a minute after Tom was found no man stirred. Tom was quick of brain
      and wit&mdash;would it had always been put, to good purposes!&mdash;and
      saw at once Faddo&rsquo;s treachery. Like winking he fired at the traitor, who
      was almost as quick to return the fire. What made you do it I know not,
      unless it was you hated treachery; but, sliding in at the open door behind
      the coast-guards, you snatched the lantern from the hands of one, threw it
      out of the open door, and, thrusting them aside, called for Tom to follow
      you. He sprang towards you over Faddo&rsquo;s body, even as you threw the
      lantern, and, catching his arm, you ran with him towards the dyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ready for a great jump!&rsquo; you said. &lsquo;Your life hangs on it.&rsquo; He was even
      longer of leg than you. &lsquo;Is it a dyke?&rsquo; he whispered, as the shots from
      three muskets rang after you. &lsquo;A dyke. When I count three, jump,&rsquo; you
      answered. I have read somewhere of the great leap that one Don Alvarado, a
      Spaniard, made in Mexico, but surely never was a greater leap than you two
      made that night, landing safely on the other side, and making for the
      sea-shore. None of the coast guardsmen, not even Lancy, could make the
      leap, for he was sick and trembling, though he had fired upon his own
      brother. And so they made for the bridge some distance above, just as the
      faint moon slipped behind a cloud and hid you from their sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is no country to hide in, as you know well, no caves, or hills, or
      mazy coombes, just a wide, flat, reedy place, broken by open woods. The
      only refuge for both now was the sea. &lsquo;Twas a wild run you two made, side
      by side, down that shore, keeping close within the gloom of the
      sand-hills, the coast-guards coming after, pressing you closer than they
      thought at the time, for Tom Doane had been wounded in the leg. But Lancy
      sent one back for the horses, he and the other coming on; and so, there
      you were, two and two. &lsquo;Twas a cruel task for Lancy that night, enough to
      turn a man&rsquo;s hair grey. But duty was duty, though those two lads were more
      to each other than most men ever are. You know how it ended. But I want to
      go all over it just to show you that I understand. You were within a mile
      of Mablethorpe, when you saw a little fishing smack come riding in, and
      you made straight for it. Who should be in the smack but Solby, the
      canting Baptist, who was no friend to you or my uncle, or any of us. You
      had no time for bargaining or coaxing, and so, at the musket&rsquo;s mouth, you
      drove him from the boat, and pushed it out just as Lancy and his men came
      riding up. Your sail was up, and you turned the lugger to the wind in as
      little time as could be, but the coast-guardsmen rode after you, calling
      you to give in. No man will ever know the bitter trouble in Lancy&rsquo;s heart
      when he gave the order to fire on you, though he did not fire himself. And
      you&mdash;do I not know, Cousin Dick, what you did? Tom Doane was not the
      man to fire at the three dark figures riding you down, not knowing which
      was his brother. But you, you understood that; and you were in, you said
      to yourself, and you&rsquo;d play the game out, come what would. You raised your
      musket and drew upon a figure. At that moment a coast-guard&rsquo;s musket
      blazed, and you saw the man you had drawn on was Lancy Doane. You lowered
      your musket, and as you did a ball struck you on the wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have thanked God a hundred times, dear Cousin Dick, that you fired
      no shot that night, but only helped a hunted, miserable man away, for you
      did get free. Just in the nick of time your sail caught the wind, and you
      steered for the open sea. Three days from that, Tom Doane was safe in the
      Low Country, and you were on your way back to Lincolnshire. You came by a
      fishing boat to Saltfleet Haven, and made your way down the coast towards
      Mablethorpe. Passing Theddlethorpe, you went up to Faddo&rsquo;s house, and,
      looking through the window, you saw Faddo, not dead, but being cared for
      by his wife. Then you came on to Mablethorpe, and standing under my
      window, at the very moment when I was on my knees praying for the safety
      of those who travelled by sea, you whistled like a quail from the garden
      below&mdash;the old signal. Oh, how my heart stood still a moment and then
      leaped, for I knew it was you! I went down to the garden, and there you
      were. Oh, but I was glad to see you, Cousin Dick!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember how I let you take me in your arms for an instant, and then
      I asked if he was safe. And when you told me that he was, I burst into
      tears, and I asked you many questions about him. And you answered them
      quickly, and then would have taken me in your arms again. But I would not
      let you, for then I knew&mdash;I knew that you loved me, and, oh, a
      dreadful feeling came into my heart, and I drew back, and could have sunk
      upon the ground in misery, but that there came a thought of your safety!
      He was safe, but you&mdash;you were here, where reward was posted for you.
      I begged you to come into the house, that I might hide you there, but you
      would not. You had come for one thing, you said, and only one. An hour or
      two, and then you must be gone for London. And so you urged me to the
      beach. I was afraid we might be seen, but you led me away from the
      cottages near to the little bridge which crosses the dyke. By that way we
      came to the sands, as we thought unnoted. But no, who should it be to see
      us but that canting Baptist, Solby! And so the alarm was given. You had
      come, dear Cousin Dick, to ask me one thing&mdash;if I loved you? and if,
      should you ever be free to come back, I would be your wife? I did not
      answer you; I could not answer you; and, when you pressed me, I begged you
      to have pity on me and not to speak of it. You thought I was not brave
      enough to love a man open to the law. As if&mdash;as if I knew not that
      what you did came out of a generous, reckless heart. And on my knees&mdash;oh,
      on my knees&mdash;I ought to have thanked you for it! But I knew not what
      to say; my lips were closed. And just then shots were fired, and we saw
      the coast-guards&rsquo; lights. Then came Lancy Doane stumbling down the banks,
      and our parting&mdash;our parting. Your bitter laugh as you left me has
      rung in my ears ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not think we have been idle here in your cause, for I myself went to
      Earl Fitzwilliam and told him the whole story, and how you had come to
      help Tom Doane that night. How do I know of it all? Because I have seen a
      letter from Tom Doane. Well, the Earl promised to lay your case before the
      King himself, and to speak for you with good eager entreaty. And so, it
      may be, by next time I write, there will go good news to you, and&mdash;will
      you then come back, dear Cousin Dick?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I want to tell you what I know, and what you do not know. Tom
      Doane had a wife in Mablethorpe. He married her when she was but sixteen&mdash;a
      child. But she was afraid of her father&rsquo;s anger, and her husband soon
      after went abroad, became one of Prince Charlie&rsquo;s men, and she&rsquo;s never
      seen him since. She never really loved him, but she never forgot that she
      was his wife; and she always dreaded his coming back; as well she might,
      for you see what happened when he did come. I pitied her, dear Cousin
      Dick, with all my heart; and when Tom Doane died on the field of battle in
      Holland last year, I wept with her and prayed for her. And you would have
      wept too, man though you are, if you had seen how grateful she was that he
      died in honourable fighting and not in a smuggler&rsquo;s cave at Theddlethorpe.
      She blessed you for that, and she never ceases to work with me for the
      King&rsquo;s pardon for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no more to say now, dear Cousin Dick, save that I would have you
      know I think of you with great desire of heart for your well-being, and I
      pray God for your safe return some day to the good country which,
      pardoning you, will cast you out no more.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;I am, dear Cousin Dick,

             &ldquo;Thy most affectionate Cousin,

                  &ldquo;FANNY.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afterword&mdash;Dear Dick, my heart bursts for joy. Enclosed here is thy
      pardon, sent by the good Earl Fitzwilliam last night. I could serve him on
      my knees for ever. Dick, she that was Tom Doane&rsquo;s wife, she loves thee.
      Wilt thou not come back to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth, she always loved thee. She was thy cousin; she is thy Fanny.
      Now thou knowest all.&rdquo;

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
